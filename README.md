# Rides
This project is a SwiftUI-based application that leverages the MVVM architectural pattern and Combine framework to deliver a responsive and user-friendly experience. The app is designed to efficiently fetch and display data while ensuring smooth interaction and state management.

## Features

User Interface: Designed with SwiftUI to provide a modern and intuitive user interface.
Architecture: Utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for clear separation of concerns and better testability.
Data Handling: Implements Combine for reactive programming, allowing seamless data binding and updates.
API Integration: Efficiently fetches data from a remote service using URLSession and handles responses gracefully.
Environment Configuration: Supports environment-based configuration for different API hosts.

## Technologies Used

SwiftUI: For building the user interface.
Combine: For handling asynchronous events and data flow.
MVVM: To structure the application in a modular and maintainable way.
URLSession: For network requests and data retrieval.
